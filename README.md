Hello Everybody!

My name is James and I enjoy working in Finance but I see and attempt to bridge the gap between IT and Finance every day. I've been studying data science to be a better employee but have struggled with finding a company to work for that understands that the future of finance is changing. 

What I see
Financial analysts/controllers/accountants in one group and IT/Devs/Back end report building and the Finance group doesn't understand the IT domain and the IT doesn't understand the Finance domain.

I Bridge that gap but it's hard to find people that understand that. I am currently am a Financial controller of a BI department so I am getting closer. 


My long term goal is to build a tool and get proof of concept with enough visablitity to scare a google/oracle/facebook/apple/etc enough to buy me out at 5 million per partner in my startup. 

I don't care what it is or where it goes from there, just 5 million and I am done.
